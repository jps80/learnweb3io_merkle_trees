# Intro

This example is part of Learweb3.io Senior learning path:
    -    [Creating large airdrops in a gas-efficient way using Merkle Trees](https://learnweb3.io/courses/c446d19f-a25d-42c6-b3e4-4311c5040587/lessons/2a1bcd73-6397-4323-8f06-6d449582cc34)

# Creating large airdrops in a gas-efficient way using Merkle Trees

This project demonstrates how to use Merkle Trees in our SmartContracts. We can use Merkle Trees, for instance, to store information in our SmartContract with more efficiency than storing the data in variables.

Read the test (test\merkle-root.js) for better comprehension 

# Run

npx hardhat test

# ToDo

Some ideas:
    - Modify the code to allow the Merkle Tree could be updatable
